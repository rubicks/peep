  * Peep now successfully compiles on
    OpenBSD.
  * Fixed some instability with the
    mixer that caused peep to crash
    on OpenBSD.
  * peepd has undergone the valgrind

    the tcp server from handling

    files to use the latest ones in Debian
    linux.

      --enable-tcp-server or
      --enable-udp-server
    * Clients now accept either:
      --protocol=tcp or
      --protocol=udp

For Peep v0.5.0-rc1: (some highlights)
  * Created and updated Documentation for
    the 0.5.x series. Documentation format
    is now in latex and html is generated
    via latex2html.
  * Updated the general package files
    (INSTALL, README, etc.).
  * Updated the build to include the
    configuration directory and to generate
    the HTML documentation from the tex
    source during a `make dist`
  * Added the client documentation, which
    is now generated during the build
    along with the server documentation.
  * The theme format has now been fixed
    and properly implemented.
  * Auto-discovery now works.
  * UDP/SSL postponed until rc2. TCP
    support fully implemented

Peep 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of the Peep
server and clients. New features include:
  * Support for 3 protocols: UDP/TCP/SSL.
  * Plug-in architecture for post-processing
  * XML messaging
  * New sound effect architecture - makes
    adding new effects simple
  * XML themes! <- Portable themes that allow
    a Peep installation to configure out of
    the box.
  * Better stability. Yeah. This should be
    a lot more stable.
  * New repository layout. Sounds are better
    organized and organization is now based
    on directory structure, rather than file
    numbers.
  * ALSA 0.9.x support (But untested).
  * Better debugging support
