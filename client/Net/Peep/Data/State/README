This module consists of client libraries and executables for Peep: The
Network Auralizer.

For more information, consult

  http://peep.sourceforge.net

or 

  collin.starkweather@collinstarkweather.com

Full documentation on the Peep client libraries can be found by
installing Net::Peep, then typing

  perldoc Net::Peep 

from the command prompt.  

My responses may or may not be timely depending on what kind of mood
I'm in, though in general I try to answer my mail promptly.

Installation
------------

To install this module, use the time-honored

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You may also install the latest stable version from the CPAN via

  perl -MCPAN -e "install Net::Peep"

so long as you say thanks to Andreas König, without whom CPAN.pm
would not exist.
